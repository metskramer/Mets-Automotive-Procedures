Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------

The *USB Manual* explains the projects and tasks in the USB workcycle. 
This manual breaks them down into sub-projects and tasks associated with the sub-projects.
The two main parts of any project are the tasks and the time allotted to each task.
By standardizing the workflow into tasks and time limits to complete the tasks,
the company is able to properly budget workload and timelines so that maximum efficiency can be achieved.

Sub-Projects and Tasks
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The *USB Manual* is organized into sub-projects and tasks.
For example,
the first sub-project in the USB Manual is *Preassemblies*.
The tasks associated with Preassemblies are:

	 - Pintle‐Plate‐Pin,
	 - Mag Lights,
	 - Horizontal Door Chains,
	 - Produce Door Rods.
	 
Task IDs
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Each task is assigned an identifying number,
for example,
205 ‐ Install/Finish.
The task IDs allow us to track time to work in our computer system,
thereby maintaining efficiency in understanding our work and the time required.


Procedures
---------------------------------------


The following procedures comprise the USB Workflow.

Preassemblies
+++++++++++++++++++

The preassemblies are to be done before the main USB projects.
They are small side-jobs that are alongside the main work of the USB projects.
The preassemblies are as follows.

Pintle‐Plate‐Pin
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A pintle-plate-pin, 
or pintle-hitch-pin as it is sometimes referred,
is  a pin or bolt, usually inserted into a gudgeon, 
which is used as part of a pivot or hinge.
